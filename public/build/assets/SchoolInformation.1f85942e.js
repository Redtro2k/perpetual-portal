Kaypian San Jose Del Monte Bulacan. Mrs. Antolin founded the school in Bulacan out of public demand, through the encouragement of the Homeowners Association, it was conceptualized. It is said that students there need to travel far just to attend school. So as a response to that scarcity they built the first private school in Palmera, mainly it only facilitates pre-school up to kindergarten, but as time goes by, they added grade level or elementary level to their curriculum.
